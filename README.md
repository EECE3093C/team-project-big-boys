### Vision
(Describe the top-level objectives, differentiators, target customers, and scope of your product)
#### What is your product (high-level view)?
Our product is a Fitness Software that will remove the need to predict or wait for certain equipment in the gym. Instead, gym memebers will be able to glance at a screen to see available machines and benches. It will take advantage of pressure sensors that are integrated into pads to determine if gym memebers are still using a machine, inbetween sets, or finished with their exercise. These stages will be presented through a "stoplight" color system. Red determining the machine is actively in use, yellow stating a member could be inbetween sets, and green indicating that the machine is available for use.
#### Whom is it for?
Our product is for gym owners and members.
#### What problem does it solve?
Wasting time in the gym trying to figure out if certain machines are in use.
#### What alternatives are available, who are your competitors?

#### What is novel in your approach, that is "why is this project compelling and worth developing"?

### Software Architecture
Make it clear that the system can be built, making good use of the available resources and technology. Describe at a very high level the system's architecture, identifying the componenets/modules that will interact. Describe the specific data you will access/store. What languages/toolkits do you intend to use for the development?

### Challenges and Risks
What is the single most serious challenge you see in developing the produt on schedule? How will you minimize or mitigate the risk?
Our team believes one of the most serioues challenges we will see in developing this product is working with the pressure sensor to use weight and time to determine the formula we will use to see if the user is still using the machine. We decided the best way to tackle this is simply by trial and error. Going through each of the possible situtations so that there are no results our software cannot account for.
